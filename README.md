My homepage, allegedly. I've set it to my new tab page, and it houses many things I need to be sorta productive
# Quickstart
_You don't want to use this._ There are much better ways to do this, from people who write much better code. That being said...

Set a Firebase project, and set it up with a web app and appropriate data structure. ALso grab an API key from the quotes service, and input them on the alert that shows up on load. They're saved to localStorage. This is how I'm doing it, as I don't know how to properly secure API creds without a server.
